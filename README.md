# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Travelling Salesman Problem Visualization made with JavaScript, the objective is to find the shortest route so that a traveller goes to n cities, but as more cities are added, time to solve increases exponentially.

### Included:
- Add Dots (form on the left) - Type coordinates in x y format (suitable examples are 5 10; 2 7; 20 0).
- Press Dot (inside the map) - Press a dot to delete it from the list of dots.
- Reorder Dots (form on the left) - Select position for the dots by typing position number (the first starts at 1) and pressing the coordinates.
- Save Sum (form on the right) - Save path configuration by pressing the button on the right form.
- Run Saved Sum (form on the right) - Press a saved sum to return to its configuration or delete it with the button on the right.
- Run Algorithm (above, next to title) - Select a number and press run to run a determined algorithm (currently, selecting 2 gives random paths for the displayed dots with 1 second intervals in between and 3 goes through 500 paths and saves the shortest, you can add new numbers in the code and your own algorithms)
